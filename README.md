CivCraft is a massive, server side Minecraft modification written for Bukkit. In CivCraft, players band together to construct camps, towns, and civilizations which go on to research technology, engage in diplomacy, build wonders, and fight for world dominance. 

In addition to the CivCraft game this plugin also includes a multi-server ban and server perk system to use inside of a large server hub.
